            <p>The National Testing Agency is going to conduc JEE Main 2020 from September (tentative). Both the papers of JEE Main 2019 i.e., Paper I and Paper II will be conducted in computer based test mode (except for Drawing Section of Paper II). Most of the students think offline mode of examination is better than online mode. That&rsquo;s why appearing candidates are searching for the best way to attempt the online test. Here, we are providing the most important tips which will help JEE Main aspirants to perform well in the computer based test conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA).</p>
            <p><strong>Let's study about these tips in detail:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>1. Read all the instruction very carefully:</strong></p>
            <p>First of all students should read all the instructions that appear on the computer screen at the time of exam. Sometimes students think reading instructions will waste their time. But students get extra time for reading instructions apart from 3 hours.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Make strategies after reading the complete question paper only:</strong></p>
            <p>To view the complete question paper, students can click on the &ldquo;Question Paper&rdquo; on the right side at the top. After going through the complete paper, students will get an idea about the difficulty level of all the subjects. Thereafter, students can easily make the strategies to attempt the paper.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Read the complete question:</strong></p>
            <p>Sometimes the question may be lengthy enough which makes it impossible to appear the complete questions on the screen at a time. Therefore, students must read the complete question with the help of the scroll button of mouse before attempting the question.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Use the options of changing language if not able to understand the question:</strong></p>
            <p>If students face difficulty in understanding the question, then they can change the language of that particular question. After understanding the question, students should start solving the questions but they should remember that time is very crucial. If JEE Main aspirants are not 100% sure about the answer then, they should leave that question and go for next question.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Note all the values very carefully in your rough sheet:</strong></p>
            <p>In JEE Main Computer Based Test 2019, students will have to do each and every calculation on their rough sheet. Thus, students must be very conscious while transferring data from computer screen to rough sheet. Taking incorrect value will gave them wrong answer and will waste their precious time.</p>
            <p><strong>6. Use Save &amp; Mark for Review when you have any doubt:</strong></p>
            <p>If engineering aspirants have any doubt after solving the questions then, they can use&nbsp;<strong>Save &amp; Mark for Review</strong>&nbsp;option. This option will change the color of the question number in the question template on the right side. Students can visit these questions in one go when they have time remaining before the exam.</p>
            <p><strong>7. Don&rsquo;t panic in case of computer failure:</strong></p>
            <p>Sometimes system may get shutdown due to some technical glitches. In such conditions student don&rsquo;t panic. The exam will resume from the same point. Therefore, students don&rsquo;t lose their concentration and try to remain focused.</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
            <p>We hope that, the above tips will help students in getting good marks in JEE Main CBT 2019. Apart from these tips, appearing candidates must attempt&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jagranjosh.com/articles/jee-main-free-online-mock-test-series-by-nta-1513754666-1" target="_blank"><strong>Mock Test</strong></a>&nbsp;for JEE Main 2019 released by the National Testing Agency.

            <p><strong>1. Make Use of the Revision Notes and Flashcards Regularly</strong></p>
            <p>While revising any unit go through your previously prepared notes. This process will help you to strengthen concepts in your memory and hence, applying them becomes much easier. If you haven&rsquo;t prepared flashcards in past then don&rsquo;t waste time in preparing them now. Although flashcards would&rsquo;ve made it easier for recollection, your notes will also suffice.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Prepare a Proper Study Time-table and Stick To It</strong></p>
            <p>Understand each and every topic included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://byjus.com/jee/jee-syllabus/">JEE Syllabus</a>&nbsp;and accordingly formulate a proper study plan. Schedule all your breaks, sleep cycle and study time in this timetable and make sure you stick to it. Set goals and include it as a part of your schedule.

Set appropriate time limits to practice questions and ensure that it helps in managing time during the actual JEE Exam.</p>
            <p><strong>3. At the time of Revision, Don&rsquo;t Focus on Learning Anything New</strong></p>
            <p>As mentioned above, your revision time should only be used to revise units that you have already learned. Don&rsquo;t focus on learning any new concept at this time because learning anything new may also weaken your confidence at this stage.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Practice ample of Past year&rsquo;s Question papers and Mock Tests:</strong></p>
            <p>After studying certain concepts, it is better to practice questions from the past years&rsquo; question papers. It will help you to test or analyze your preparation level for JEE exams. Solving previous years&rsquo; question papers will help you gain higher confidence and it also enhances your exam temperament. Don&rsquo;t forget to attempt sample mock tests. These tests should be attempted to know how to manage time and pressure of the actual examination. Therefore, you should set conditions as an ideal to the actual situation with no distractions. Practice several numbers of application-based questions from previous papers.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Take Breaks and Ensure a Healthy Sleep Cycle:</strong></p>
            <p>Make sure to take enough scheduled breaks and maintain a regular sleep cycle. It is obviously not possible to study for the whole day or night. Since most of the hard work is done by your brain, therefore, you should give it sufficient time to recuperate.

        image: image4,
        author: 'By GURMEET KAUR, Jagran JOSH',

            <p>Here you will know 10 most effective tips to avoid sleep while studying for long hours. You will know how small changes in your study pattern can help you throw away the drowsiness and study properly for long hours.</p>
            <p>Sleep becomes the biggest hurdle when you have to study for long hours at night to prepare for any important test or exam. It seems like pulling you back from reaching your goal. When you study with a fresh mind in the morning, it becomes really easy to grab the things but at certain periods like in the afternoon and at late night, sleep becomes inevitable as you try to stretch your study hours. Actually, it happens when you are restless. At such times, you are left with two options; first is keeping the books aside and lie down to take rest and second is fighting against the drowsiness to keep yourself awake. But sleeping while studying is too easy, the real deal is to ditch sleep and stay awake.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Here, in this article you will get some useful and lucrative tips that you can follow to avoid sleep while studying for long hours.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>1. Keep your study room well lighted</strong></p>
            <p>The biggest mistake most of the students make is studying with just a table lamp lit in the whole room due to which a significant portion of the room remains dark, promoting a cosy environment which would eventually make you more tempted to go to that charming bed with dim surroundings. So, to avoid such comfy situation, keep your room bright and well lighted.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Sit in a chair, not on bed</strong></p>
            <p>Your sitting position also matters a lot while studying for long hours. Try to seat yourself in a chair with back support and a table in front. It will help you stay active and alert while studying. On the other hand, if you lie on your bed while studying you may get into lazy mode, eventually making you feel sleepy. While sitting on the chair, keep moving your body parts at regular intervals so that you don&rsquo;t go in dormancy.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Avoid heavy meals</strong></p>
            <p>We&rsquo;ve all felt that drowsy feeling that sneaks in after a meal and if you have to study with such snoozing mood than no one can help it. Actually, after having a heavy meal, you are full and relaxed and you are struggling to keep your eyes open.&nbsp;Lethargy that comes after consuming a heavy diet diminishes the retention power. Also, when you feel lazy, you are more likely to hit the bed. But don&rsquo;t think that you will have to go on a starvation to avoid this sluggishness. Instead, you should take your meals early and opt for small meals.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Drink lots of water</strong></p>
            <p>Here, water is being recommended not only to keep you hydrated but also to keep you alert. Actually, it&rsquo;s the best trick that most of the students apply while studying. When you drink a considerable quantity of water, you will have to make frequent trips to bathroom for pee, keeping you moving and alert. Moreover, drinking an adequate quantity of water helps to keep the brain well hydrated, increasing its memory and retention power.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Follow &lsquo;Early to bed, early to rise&rsquo; funda</strong></p>
            <p>This comes from a famous saying, &ldquo;Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise&rdquo;. This is absolutely true because if you manage to go to sleep early in night then you will get adequate sleep, waking up to a fresh and energetic day. With a fresh mind you can concentrate on your studies quite well. A fresh mind has a better concentration power to retain an information.</p>
            <p><strong>6. Take a nap in the afternoon</strong></p>
            <p>If you have been continuously studying since morning, then an afternoon nap is a must to save your brain from getting exhausted. It would also help you avoid sleep during studying at late night. A short nap is enough to keep you alert keeping the drowsiness away.</p>
            <p><strong>7. Keep your body parts alert and awake</strong></p>
            <p>If you keep on studying with the same stagnant position for long hours, then you are more likely to get surrounded by laziness and drowsiness. So, the moment you start feeling sleepy, get up from your chair and move around in your room and stretch your legs and arms. You may study while walking around your room. It has been observed that study while walking, not only helps in avoiding the sleep, but also enhances concentration.</p>
            <p><strong>8. Read out aloud while studying</strong></p>
            <p>This trick works really well to keep away the lethargy. It minimizes the chances of falling asleep while studying. It has something to do with listening to your own voice. Try to teach yourself like the teacher explains a topic in the classroom. This will not only help to throw away the drowsiness, but also to improve your learning power.</p>
            <p><strong>9. Learn by writing</strong></p>
            <p>If you will keep on reading the text to be learned then it will create a monotonous situation due to which you are more likely to start feeling bored which will ultimately give invitation to sleepiness. To keep the lethargy away, you are advised not to merely be a spectator, but learn by writing so that your brain remains active doing the pen and paper work and recalling the things you have learned.</p>
            <p><strong>10. Avoid studying difficult topics at night</strong></p>
            <p>During the night you feel more sluggish if you are solving complex problems or trying to learn the difficult topics. Try to tackle only the light and easy portions of syllabus during night. Leave the tough portions for day time when your body and brain are fresh and active. For the late night study, pick only those topics which are easy, interesting and are your favourite ones.</p>
            <p>So, dear students, if you want to earn those extra grades by sacrificing your sleep, then the above stated tricks will surely help you&nbsp; to meet your desired academic goals.</p>

            <h3>4. JEE Main Preparation Tips &ndash; Time Management</h3>
            <p>Investing your time sensibly is the key to cracking any entrance exam. It is necessary to be selective and rigid. Students need to find out the right kind of study materials and spend just the right amount of time practising each topic. Not only are you required to follow an effective timetable, but you also, make use of efficient time management in the entire process of preparation until writing the exam, which is a major deciding factor. You must include time management in your JEE Main preparation plan.</p>

            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">First thing is that syllabus of chemistry is huge in JEE. I would suggest you to start with NCERT Chemistry XI &amp; XII &amp; then with the other materials you have.</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">Now follow these steps for each topic you want to memorise :-</p>
            <ul class="q-box">
                <li class="q-relative">Collect Questions :-&nbsp;Start collecting different questions from the topic which you will be reading soon.</li>
                <li class="q-relative">Start Reading :-&nbsp;Forget that you need to memorise things. Just simply start reading the topic with the materials that you have with NCERT.</li>
                <li class="q-relative">Start Solving :-&nbsp;Now this is big time for you, start solving the questions you collected and try to remember the concepts and facts involved.You will not be able to solve all of them.&nbsp;No Worries&nbsp;! because syllabus is huge.</li>
                <li class="q-relative">Move on to the next topic :-&nbsp;Now do all the above three steps for each topics you are aiming to memorise.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">Now&nbsp;repeat the process&nbsp;for each topic after an interval of 15 days or 1 month as per your convenience. In intial days you will observe the interval time is big, but as soon as time moves on you yourself will find ease in making the interval time small. After enough number of loops which may take a year or two, very soon you will realise you are doing good in chemistry.</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">To boost up your confidence before JEE start solving previous year&rsquo;s questions.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry if you are not able to solve all of them because you already solved enough of them. And if you are able to solve all of them its excellent.</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">See many times concepts hit in your brain when you encounter a question involving those respective concepts, so don&rsquo;t worry with the question that whether or not i remember complete chemistry ?</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">Got my point, now go and start following. All the best. Thank you for reading :)</p>

        time: "Jan 11",
        content: <div>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">Physics is a subject of concepts.&nbsp;Solving too many problems are not going to help you much. Some of the tips are given below (specially for JEE aspirants. Almost same can be applied for NEET aspirants also):</p>
            <ol class="q-box">
                <li class="q-relative">Make your concepts very very strong. There will be hardly 500&ndash;1000 concepts in whole physics. Take one concept and think all possible cases about it. I give you a small example:&nbsp;Normal reaction:&nbsp;what are the important points in it: perpendicular to the surface, towards the surface, equal and opposite acting on two different bodies, just like pressure (or pressure force PA) between two bodies in contact, minimum value is zero where two bodies leave contact with each other, there is some maximum limit also where the weaker body breaks, electromagnetic and component of net contact force in normal direction, work done by normal reaction is not always zero etc. etc.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">2. Don&rsquo;t miss a single class wherever you are studying.</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">3. Your concentration level in the class should be 100%.</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">4. Keep only one standard book with you. There are many drawbacks when you keep so many books in front of you. A lot of concepts and problems are usually repeated in different books. So basically you are just wasting your valuable time in similar types of concepts/problems if you are solving different books. You have to cover all chapters in all the subjects. If you have too many books, then what normally you will do is: do one chapter from one book and then repeat the same chapter from the other book. By doing so your course lags and when your exams are near you are disturbed because of incompletion of many chapters.</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">5. In one book theory, selection of book is very important. Theory should be to the point. Questions should be relevant and within the syllabus. Number of problems in the book should be neither too less nor too more. If level of IIT-JEE is x then the problems should start from zero level and reach up to 1.25x. There is no need of touching 1.5x level. In complete theory, examples and exercises almost all concepts and types of problems which are normally asked in the examinations should be covered. Level of examples and questions should increase very gradually.</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">6. I never say you follow my books. If you are following my books then I have tried my level best to incorporate all above points mentioned in point number 5 in my books. Even if you are following any other book same strategy applies to all.</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">7. There are roughly 7000 examples and problems in my all&nbsp;five text book.&nbsp;Some of them are very simple. It would hardly take more than 15 sec. But they are also very important.</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">8. If you start preparing for IIT-JEE from class 11th in the month of April then try to complete all five text books till August next year. So you have total 480 days. Per day target is 14.6.</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">9. After finishing one chapter in your classes read each and every word of above books and complete your daily target of examples /problems by all means. If your theory part is very clear in your classes then you can leave the theory part. Though all points are usually not covered in the classroom. Some problems/examples will be very simple so that particular day you can increase your numbers and this time you can utilise in tough problems. If you are unable to solve a particular problem, then just mark it and in your free time think over it just like a philosopher. After two three attempts if you are further unable to solve then, just see the solution of it which is given at book end. If you attend all classes, read complete theory, see all examples and solve all problems then I am sure till August month (next year) you will feel very comfortable in Physics. You can&rsquo;t do too many problems. So if you follow the above strategy then don&rsquo;t try any other book/material. Problems in the above books are given in a systematic increasing order of difficulty level. So if you move step by step then you will not feel any difficulty. I assure you that.</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">10. From September to first Main Exam of January month keep two more books in front of you.&nbsp;New pattern&nbsp;written by myself and&nbsp;IIT-JEE previous years&rsquo; papers. Try to complete each and every problem of these two books. You can leave the subjective problems of IIT-JEE previous years&rsquo; papers at this stage. If you qualify this stage then in the remaining months complete subjective problems of IIT-JEE previous years&rsquo; papers, an another book written by me&nbsp;Five hundred selected problems of Physics&nbsp;and all logical problems of&nbsp;Irodov. If you can&rsquo;t then repeat those books once again (New pattern and IIT-JEE previous years&rsquo; papers, excluding its subjective problems) and just after the April Mains exam, complete subjective problems of IIT-JEE previous years&rsquo; papers, Five hundred selected problems of Physics. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">If you follow each and every word of above strategy, then I am sure you will give your best in the exams. And this is very important because due to wrong strategy and doing the things in mismanaged manner most of us don&rsquo;t give our best performance. Your personal talent in physics subject and luck factor at last moment also matters. That is beyond our control and I can&rsquo;t speak about it. Your school studies are also not covered in this message.</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">Good Luck Students</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">👍👍👍</p>

            <h4>1.&nbsp;How To Revise Class 11 For JEE &ndash;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Start Early</h4>
            <p>The best time to start how to revise Class 11 for JEE is immediately after you enter your Class 12. The syllabus is fresh in your head and you can revise everything really quickly. Students, on an average, have revised their entire class 11 syllabus by starting early in just about 2 months!</p>
            <h4>2. How To Revise Class 11 For JEE &ndash; Prioritise the important chapters</h4>
            <p>If you haven&rsquo;t started early and been too busy trying to cope with new Class 12 theories and concepts, you would be wise to start revising at least the most important chapters! Read on to get the JEE important chapters so you can start your journey on how to revise Class 11 for JEE.</p>
            <p>Embibe has broken down the JEE Main Important Chapters from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.embibe.com/exams/jee-main-syllabus/?utm_source=Exams&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=Exams_to_PTL" target="_blank"><strong>JEE Main syllabus</strong></a>&nbsp;into&nbsp;<strong>4 different categories</strong>&nbsp;based on&nbsp;<strong>weightage</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>difficulty level</strong>.</p>
            <h4>How To Revise Class 11 For JEE &ndash; Chapterwise Weightage &amp; Difficulty Level</h4>
            <p>We have divided the chapters based on the &lsquo;<strong>weightage&rsquo; (importance to the exam)</strong>&nbsp;vs. the&nbsp;<strong>amount of input (the effort to learn and understand)</strong>&nbsp;required to master them.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;These are the second most important group of chapters. You will probably have to spend a lot of time on these chapters.</p>
