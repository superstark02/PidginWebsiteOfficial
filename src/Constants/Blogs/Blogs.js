            <p>The National Testing Agency is going to conduc JEE Main 2020 from September (tentative). Both the papers of JEE Main 2019 i.e., Paper I and Paper II will be conducted in computer based test mode (except for Drawing Section of Paper II). Most of the students think offline mode of examination is better than online mode. That&rsquo;s why appearing candidates are searching for the best way to attempt the online test. Here, we are providing the most important tips which will help JEE Main aspirants to perform well in the computer based test conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA).</p>
            <p><strong>Let's study about these tips in detail:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>1. Read all the instruction very carefully:</strong></p>
            <p>First of all students should read all the instructions that appear on the computer screen at the time of exam. Sometimes students think reading instructions will waste their time. But students get extra time for reading instructions apart from 3 hours.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Make strategies after reading the complete question paper only:</strong></p>
            <p>To view the complete question paper, students can click on the &ldquo;Question Paper&rdquo; on the right side at the top. After going through the complete paper, students will get an idea about the difficulty level of all the subjects. Thereafter, students can easily make the strategies to attempt the paper.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Read the complete question:</strong></p>
            <p>Sometimes the question may be lengthy enough which makes it impossible to appear the complete questions on the screen at a time. Therefore, students must read the complete question with the help of the scroll button of mouse before attempting the question.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Use the options of changing language if not able to understand the question:</strong></p>
            <p>If students face difficulty in understanding the question, then they can change the language of that particular question. After understanding the question, students should start solving the questions but they should remember that time is very crucial. If JEE Main aspirants are not 100% sure about the answer then, they should leave that question and go for next question.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Note all the values very carefully in your rough sheet:</strong></p>
            <p>In JEE Main Computer Based Test 2019, students will have to do each and every calculation on their rough sheet. Thus, students must be very conscious while transferring data from computer screen to rough sheet. Taking incorrect value will gave them wrong answer and will waste their precious time.</p>
            <p><strong>6. Use Save &amp; Mark for Review when you have any doubt:</strong></p>
            <p>If engineering aspirants have any doubt after solving the questions then, they can use&nbsp;<strong>Save &amp; Mark for Review</strong>&nbsp;option. This option will change the color of the question number in the question template on the right side. Students can visit these questions in one go when they have time remaining before the exam.</p>
            <p><strong>7. Don&rsquo;t panic in case of computer failure:</strong></p>
            <p>Sometimes system may get shutdown due to some technical glitches. In such conditions student don&rsquo;t panic. The exam will resume from the same point. Therefore, students don&rsquo;t lose their concentration and try to remain focused.</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
            <p>We hope that, the above tips will help students in getting good marks in JEE Main CBT 2019. Apart from these tips, appearing candidates must attempt&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jagranjosh.com/articles/jee-main-free-online-mock-test-series-by-nta-1513754666-1" target="_blank"><strong>Mock Test</strong></a>&nbsp;for JEE Main 2019 released by the National Testing Agency.

            <p><strong>1. Make Use of the Revision Notes and Flashcards Regularly</strong></p>
            <p>While revising any unit go through your previously prepared notes. This process will help you to strengthen concepts in your memory and hence, applying them becomes much easier. If you haven&rsquo;t prepared flashcards in past then don&rsquo;t waste time in preparing them now. Although flashcards would&rsquo;ve made it easier for recollection, your notes will also suffice.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Prepare a Proper Study Time-table and Stick To It</strong></p>

            <p><strong>4. Practice ample of Past year&rsquo;s Question papers and Mock Tests:</strong></p>
