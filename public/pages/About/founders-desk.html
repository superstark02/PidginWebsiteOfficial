        The blessings of our parents (Lt. Smt. Meera Sharma and Lt. Sh. H.C. Sharma) and their loving memory inspired us
        to lay the foundation of MeeraSight Clinic.



        Having been elected as President of C5C Block, Janak Puri, Mr. H.C. Sharma did outstanding work that shall
        remain praiseworthy in hearts of residents of our block. He was the favorite among the members of welfare
        association and residents for his modesty and problem solving attitude.

        ​

        His wife Mrs. Meera Sharma has always been his back bone and shared equal credits for the respect he earned
        throughout his life. Being a home maker she took care of kids (Amit & Priya) and has given her strength to push
        through difficult times while he was away for social work.

        ​

        They have inspired us to pursue the objective of community service through treatment of people with utmost care.
        MeeraSight is an effort to inculcate same in generations to follow.

        Father

        (Superintending Geologist, Deptt. of Mines and Geology, Rajasthan)

        The constant motivation of our parents Mr. Ved Prakash Gahlot and Mrs. Sharda Gahlot was instrumental in
        inception of MeeraSight in its present form.



        Being a Scientist and an Educator they always motivated their children (Sonia and Anshuman) to aspire for
        excellence and attain maximum qualification in their profession. Also guided to keep up with latest innovations
        in our field. It is their hard work and inspiration which has made us join medical profession and be the best in
        their fields.

        ​

        Their joint efforts have shown us the way we can serve the community we live in, by providing the best eye care
        which is affordable and easily approachable next door.
