    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
        Our utmost emphasis is on Quality and patient safety while providing best treatment through the highest
        qualified team which came together as a part of this venture at Meerasight.

        ​

        Our new center has been designed keeping patient satisfaction and comfort in mind. We have the latest diagnostic
        equipments with cutting edge technology to provide class leading eye care. It has the most advanced modular
        Operation Theatre which has been designed as per guidelines and recommendations laid by NABH which is pushing
        the boundaries of highest standards in healthcare. Apart from patient satisfaction, for patient safety we have
        an operation theatre fitted with Laminar Air Flow which makes us class apart. The Air Handling Unit eliminates
        the danger of infection during surgery to a large extent by filtering out harmful germs from the air.

        ​

        MeeraSight is more than just an Eye Care Center — it’s a growing community! Dedicated to treating patients since
        2014, we involve patients in the decision making for their treatment by providing them with all the information
        they need about their condition and it's treatment.
