        Are 3-D Movies Bad for Your Eyes?
        Updated: Apr 2

        3-D movies have come a long way since the days of 1950’s classics like the House of Wax and the Creature from
        the Black Lagoon. With blockbuster 3-D movies like Avatar breaking records and the popularity of 3-D gaming, TV
        networks and TV sets on the rise, it seems that three-dimensional viewing is here to stay, but is it good for
        your or your children’s eyes?




        No evidence of harmful effects


        You may have read the warnings on your 3-D game or TV, “Warning: Children and teenagers may be more susceptible
        to health issues associated with viewing in 3D…etc.” However, according to the American Academy of
        Ophthalmology, there are currently no conclusive studies on the short- and/or long-term effects of 3-D viewing
        on visual development or eye health in children.


        3-D viewing challenges

        However, even though there is no current evidence of long-term effects, some people experience discomfort when
        watching stereoscopic images. The process of the eyes converging to see images in front of or beyond the screen
        can create eyestrain and headaches. Sitting at a greater distance from the screen can help alleviate this
        problem. Viewers with visual motion hypersensitivity (VHM), which can cause motion sickness and
        vergence-accommodation confilict, may experience dizziness and nausea from 3-D viewing. Those with amblyopia (an
        imbalance in visual strength between both eyes) or strabismus (misalighned eyes) may have difficulty seeing 3-D
        images. There is also a small population of people who lack binocular vision and therefore can’t see 3-D images
        at all.


        3-D as vision test

        This potential of discomfort has an upside as the ability to perceive depth in 3-D can be a highly sensitive
        test of a range of vision health indicators. For the 1 in 4 children suffering from underlying vision issues and
        the 3 to 9 million people with binocular vision problems, viewing 3-D TV and movies can help identify problems
        and thereby lead to treatments.


        Educational benefits

        In addition to the benefit of exposing underlying vision issues, 3-D viewing can have educational benefits as
        well. For instance, studies have shown teaching in 3-D can result in significant improvement in comprehension
        and retention over traditional presentations. To learn more about 3D in the classroom, read this public health
        report by the American Optometric Association (AOA) on the subject.


        If you or your child experience any issues with 3-D viewing, be sure to make an appointment for a comprehensive
        eye exam with your eye care professional. Turns out that 3-D blockbuster you just saw may lead to improving your
        vision and eye health!
