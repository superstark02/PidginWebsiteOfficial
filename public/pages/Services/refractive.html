    <h2>Refractive Service</h2>

    <p>
        Refractive errors are optical imperfections that prevent the eye from properly focusing light, causing blurred
        vision which can be for distance vision, near vision or reading or both. If this happens in early age it can
        lead to crossing of eyes or squint in children and may cause permanent damage to vision.

        ​

        Types of Refractive errors

        Nearsightedness (Myopia)

        Farsightedness (Hyperopia)

        Astigmatism

        Presbyopia (aging of the lens in the eye).

        ​

        A refractive error can be diagnosed by us during a routine eye examination. Testing usually consists of asking
        you to read a vision chart while testing an assortment of lenses to maximize your vision. This process can be
        augmented with help of an auto refractor. Special imaging or other testing is rarely necessary.

        ​

        Treatment of Refractive Errors:

        ​

        Spectacles or glasses

        Contact lenses

        Refractive surgeries

        Laser Vision correction

        PRK (Surface Ablation)

        LASIK (Flap Surgery)

        SMILE (Flapless Surgery)

        Phakic IOL/ICL

        ​

        There is no universally-accepted, best method for correcting refractive errors. The best option for you should
        be decided after a thorough examination and discussion about your lifestyle and your vision needs.
