    <h2>Cornea Services</h2>

    <p>
        The cornea is your eye’s clear, front, protective outer layer of the eye. Along with the sclera (the white of
        your eye), it serves as a barrier against dirt, germs, and other things that can cause damage. It also plays a
        key role in vision. As light enters your eye, it gets refracted, or bent, by the cornea’s curved edge. This
        helps determine how well your eye can focus on objects close-up and far away.

        ​

        Corneal curvature and its clarity are the two factors which lead to clear vision in your eye.

        ​

        Corneal Disorders

        ​

        Any reason which leads to loss of clarity of cornea or distortion of its shape can lead to loss in vision. These
        include infections, tissue breakdown, and other genetic disorders you get from your parents.

        Common disorders of cornea are:

        ​

        Corneal ulcers- It can be bacterial, fungal or viral.

        Corneal injuries or trauma.

        Corneal Dystrophies like Fuch’s Dystrophy, Lattice Dystrophy etc.

        Corneal Degenerations like Keratoconus.

        Allergies

        You should visit an ophthalmologist if you have any of the above symptoms or if any object stuck in your eye or
        any chemical splashing in your eye or a serious eye injury or trauma — like getting hit hard in the eye.

        Treatment of Corneal disorders



        Dr Sonia Sharma at MeeraSight is experienced in treating all corneal disorders and is among very few surgeons
        who are trained in all advanced corneal procedures during her fellowship at different prestigious institutes.

        ​

        Many corneal conditions can be treated medically with prescription eye drops or pills. If you have advanced
        corneal disease, you may need a different treatment such as:-

        ​

        MeeraSight - Cornea Treatment
        Corneal transplant surgery: If the damage to your cornea can’t be repaired, doctors can remove the damaged part
        and replace it with healthy corneal tissue from a donor. It can be a full thickness transplant or a partial
        thickness/Lamellar transplant (DALK, ALTK, DSAEK/ DMEK).

        MeeraSight - Cornea Treatment
        Laser treatment: To treat some corneal dystrophies and other conditions, doctors can use a type of laser
        treatment called phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) to reshape the cornea, remove scar tissue, and make vision
        clearer.

        MeeraSight - Cornea Treatment
        Artificial cornea: As an alternative to corneal transplant, doctors can replace a damaged cornea with an
        artificial cornea, called a keratoprosthesis (KPro).
