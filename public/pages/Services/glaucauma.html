        Glaucoma is a serious eye disease caused by increased fluid pressure within the eye, which can damage the optic
        nerve that transmits images to the brain.

        ​

        Glaucoma is known as the “silent thief of sight” as it is a symptomless disease, and people usually do not
        realize that they are suffering from glaucoma unless they visit the ophthalmologist or have reached an advanced
        stage of disease.

        ​

        If undiagnosed and untreated, glaucoma can lead to irreversible loss of vision and even cause blindness. Though
        the disease is not curable, the progress of glaucoma can be halted and total blindness can be prevented if it is
        detected early.

        ​

        Its treatment includes Medication, Laser procedures and Glaucoma Surgery in patients who are not responding to
        above two treatments. Early detection and regular monitoring of progression of disease is the key to prevent
        permanent vision loss due to Glaucoma.
