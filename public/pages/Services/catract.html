    <h2>Catract</h2>

    <p>
        Cataract is the clouding of the eye's natural lens. It is the most common cause of vision loss in people over
        age 40 and is also the principal cause of blindness in the world. Cataract can blur your vision making it
        difficult to see near as well as distance objects.

        ​

        Cataract is treated surgically by Advanced Cataract surgery also known as Phacoemulsification/MICS is a simple,
        relatively painless procedure to regain vision. During surgery, we will remove your clouded lens through a very
        small cut (1.2mm-2.8mm) and in most cases replace it with a clear, plastic intraocular lens (IOL).

        ​
